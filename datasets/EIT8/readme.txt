When running the dashboard, ensure all files are in the root directory such as background and configuration.txt. Then load up anticlockwise_motion and step through it in the dashboard. 

To see the motion you will need to first baseline it so it is a difference measurement, and then adjust the sliders so that the image contrasts well.
